- Python
- SQL

## Project Scope
- Stores drug dosing references in a relational database
- Retrieves dosing information based on drug and indication
- Supports renal function–based dosing references
- Performs transparent dose calculations based on clinical parameters

## Current Status
- PostgreSQL database created
- Reference data imported and queried successfully
- Python–PostgreSQL connection established
